This is a repository for an article called _Fast MiniMax Polynomial
Approximations of Sine and Cosine_. There are different
https://github.com/publik-void/sin-cos-approximations/tree/master/targets[
distribution formats], though the
https://publik-void.github.io/sin-cos-approximations[GitHub page] is probably
the easiest to access. ðŸ™‚ Alternatively, you can download the
https://github.com/publik-void/sin-cos-approximations/raw/master/targets/sin-cos-approximations.pdf[PDF version].

There is also a
https://gist.github.com/publik-void/067f7f2fef32dbe5c27d6e215f824c91[GitHub
Gist version], which would be very convenient if GitHub's Asciidoc
Implementation would support include-directives and GitHub-hosted images. I'm
leaving this in a half-broken state here for now since there seems to be some
hope that Asciidoc on GitHub will improve in the future.
