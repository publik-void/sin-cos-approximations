This is a repository for an article called _Fast MiniMax Polynomial
Approximations of Sine and Cosine_. There are different
https://github.com/publik-void/sin-cos-approximations/tree/master/targets[distribution
formats], though the only one which is easily useable on GitHub is
https://github.com/publik-void/sin-cos-approximations/raw/master/targets/sin-cos-approximations.pdf[PDF],
unfortunately.

There is also a
https://gist.github.com/publik-void/067f7f2fef32dbe5c27d6e215f824c91[GitHub
Gist version], which would be very convenient if GitHub's Asciidoc Implementation would
support include-directives and GitHub-hosted images. I'm leaving this in a
broken state here for now since there seems to be some hope that Asciidoc on
GitHub will improve in the future.
