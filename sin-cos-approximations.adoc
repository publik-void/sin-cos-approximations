NOTE: As of March 2019, GitHub's limited Asciidoc implementation makes
getting this document to display correctly really hard. Viewing the .adoc or the
Gist version on GitHub is not recommended until this improves. Please use
https://github.com/publik-void/sin-cos-approximations/tree/master/targets[
some of the other target files] in the corresponding repository for a more
pleasant experience.
