WARNING: As of March 2019, GitHub's limited Asciidoc implementation makes
getting this document to display correctly really hard. 😕 Viewing the .adoc or
the Gist version on GitHub is not recommended until this improves. Please use
https://publik-void.github.io/sin-cos-approximations[this GitHub page version]
for a more pleasant experience.
